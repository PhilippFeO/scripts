# The srcipt opens an overview [1] of all layers of the NEOqwertz layout [2]
# with xviewer and closes it automatically. The mechanics aim to provide
# a quick possibility to search all layers for the desired letter/symbol.
#
# The script works best in combination with a global keyboard shortcut, f. e.
#   STRG + Ã–
# (so handy that German has additional letters not used by any program).
# With the global keyboard shortcut you can "open, search, switch back and
# forget".
